## Figure 1: Cluster Analysis and Phylogeny of Ligand groups.
### A) Similarity-based clustering, using CLANS, of canonical chemokines and related molecules with sequence similarity. Canonical chemokines are an independent group from other related molecules (TAFA, CYTL and CXCL17). Canonical chemokines are composed of two large groups (CC-type and CXC-type) within which some divergent subgroups are highlighted. The clustering and connections shown are at the p-value threshold of 1E-6. Other p-values tested are shown in Supplementary Figure S1. Candidate invertebrate sequences are shown as crosses and further information regarding them can be found in Supplementary Results. B) Maximum-Likelihood un-rooted phylogenetic tree of canonical chemokines. CC-type and CXC-type are split into two separate clades. Supports for key nodes are indicated in boxes with Transferable Bootstrap Expectation (TBE) represented by triangles and the Ultrafast Bootstraps (UFB) as circles. A traffic light colour code is used to indicate the level of support: high (green); intermediate (yellow) and low (red). C) Similarity-based clustering, using CLANS, of the CKLF super family (CKLFSF). Two major clusters are formed: the smaller “CKLF Group I” and the heterogenous “CKLF group II” that includes also some invertebrate sequences (shown as crosses). Subclades, including the known members of the CKLF super family, are highlighted. The clustering and connections shown are at the p-value threshold of 1E-15, as this is the threshold at which the two major clusters connect. Other p-values tested are shown in Supplementary Figure S2. D) Maximum-Likelihood un-rooted phylogenetic tree of the CKLF super family (CKLFSF). The CKLF group I is monophyletic, while the CKLF group II is not. Supports for key nodes are indicated in boxes with Transferable Bootstrap Expectation (TBE) represented by triangles and the Ultrafast Bootstraps (UFB) as circles. A traffic light colour code is used to indicate the level of support: high (green); intermediate (yellow) and low (red).
